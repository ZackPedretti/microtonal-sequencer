# microtonal-sequencer
Standalone software application that sends MIDI notes to your DAW. Made to be microtonal. Needs loopMIDI to work.
Made with the library "midir".

Can read sequences from json files.
Cannot yet send microtonal notes to the DAW.

The sequencer will use the pitch wheel to shift the pitch and play microtonal notes.
