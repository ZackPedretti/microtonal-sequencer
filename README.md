# microtonal-sequencer
Standalone software application that sends MIDI notes to your DAW. Made to be microtonal. Needs loopMIDI to work.
Made with the library "midir".

Can read sequences from json files.
The sequencer uses pitch wheel signals to send microtonal notes. In FL Studio, you need to link the controler so it registers the pitch wheel signals as such.
